# What is this?

This repository contains contains my final project for **COMP2215** module for **University of Southmapton**.

TL;DR: It is a hacky implementation of the [DuckyScript](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript) that works for the [Atmel AT90USB1286 microcontroller](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/AT90USB1286).
